        Beneath the flicker of candlelight and the hush of midnight, the Cursed Fortune Teller awaits. Each card drawn is a keyâ€”unlocking secrets, shadows, and whispers from the other side.<br /><br />
        What you seek may find you. What you fear may follow. The deck is haunted, the whispers are real, and fate is never quite what it seems.<br /><br />
        Dare to ask, and the ether will answer. But beware: not all fortunes are meant to be known.
